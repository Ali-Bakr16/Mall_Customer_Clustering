🛍️ Mall Customers Clustering Project
This project is part of my Data Mining training at ITI, where I explored customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains details about mall customers including:

🧑‍💼 CustomerID

🧍 Gender

🎂 Age

💰 Annual Income (k$)

🛒 Spending Score (1–100)

🔍 Goal:
To segment customers into distinct groups using K-Means Clustering to help the business understand spending patterns and target customers more effectively.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Python 🐍

Pandas 🧾

Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊

Scikit-learn 🤖

📈 Key Steps:
Data exploration & visualization

Data preprocessing & scaling

Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Fitting K-Means and visualizing clusters

🔎 Insights:
Clear customer segments were identified based on income and spending habits.

Visualizations help highlight differences between groups (e.g., high spenders with low income vs low spenders with high income).
